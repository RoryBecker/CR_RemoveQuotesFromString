CR_RemoveQuotesFromString
=========================

This plugin adds a new command (RemoveQuoteFromString) which when [bound to a key](https://community.devexpress.com/blogs/rorybecker/archive/2010/10/05/binding-keys-in-coderush.aspx) Will remove the initial and final quotes from around the string at the caret.
